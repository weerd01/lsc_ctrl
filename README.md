# lsc_ctrl

A small python script to control your tasmota flashed LSC Smart Connect bulbs. I didn't find any satisfactory solution to integrate these bulbs within Domoticz. I also found using a MQTT broker for controlling a few bulbs a bit overkill. I just settle with a python 3 script along with some virtual buttons from within Domoticz.

Status: very experimental. I am currently converting simple WEB requests you can send to tasmota to python 3 code/functions. It's not usable code at this moment! Once the script does something useful, i will update the status. Since i am testing/refactoring a lot, i suggest you don't waste time on this script .. yet (!) :)
